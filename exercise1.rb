#Reverse method
puts "Charlotte".reverse
#You can't reverse a number but you can reverse a string e.g. puts 40.reverse
#Ruby throws useful error messages
puts 30.to_s.reverse
#e.g. to_s -convert values to strings
#e.g. to_i -convert values to integers
#e.g. to_a -convert values to arrays

#Length method
puts "Charlotte".length
#E.g. on a password to check correct length of password

#Repeating/multiplying strings
puts "Charlotte" * 5

#Arrays
puts [12, 47, 35].max
#Gives the highest Numbers

#Variables
ticket = [1,3,2]
#Variables store information

puts ticket.sort!
#sorts- ! means modify same array rather than make a new copy that's sorted

#Learning overview
#1. The prompt- prompted for answers
#2. Numbers & strings- maths & text objects in Ruby
#3. Methods- methods are actions, English-language methods like reverse & symbolic methods like *
#4.Ruby allows you to convert between different types using "to" methods
#5. Arrays are simply lists!
#6. Arrays store their information in a sequence
#Variables store information you might use at a later point through assignment
