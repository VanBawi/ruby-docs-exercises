#Designing a class

#benefit of using objects is they keep a set of data & the methods that operate
#on that data in one place

#To create an object you're going to need classes
#Class is a blueprint for making objects
#When use a class to make an object, the class describes what the object knows
#about itself,as well as what that object does

#Things an object knows about itself are called: Instance variables
#variables that belong to one object, comprise of everything the object knows about
#itself. Represent the object's state (its data) & can have differentt values for each instance
#of the class

#Things an object does are called: Instance methods
#methods that you call directly on that object. Comprise of what the object does.
#Have access to the object's variables & use them to change their behaviour based
#on the values in those classes

#User knows: name, password -Instance Variables
#User does: subscribe, login -Instance methods

#Instance of a class is an object made using that class. Only have to write one class
#but you can make many instances of that class

#Instance is another way of saying object

#If classes are cookie cutters, objects are the cookies they make

#example- dog class
#Instance variables (state): name, age
#Instance methods (behaviour): talk, move, report_age

#RubyMonstas
#Classes are like ideas, objects are concrete things, manifestations of their ideas.


#“[Smalltalk’s] way of making objects is quite Platonic in that some of them act as […] Ideas from which manifestations can be created. That the Ideas are themselves manifestations (of the Idea-Idea) and that the Idea-Idea is a-kind-of Manifestation-Idea — which is a-kind-of itself, so that the system is completely self-describing — would have been appreciated by Plato as an extremely practical joke.” — Alan C. Kay
